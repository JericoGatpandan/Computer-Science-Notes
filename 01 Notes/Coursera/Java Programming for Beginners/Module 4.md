# Handling Exception in Java 
#RobustExceptionHandling
## An Introduction to Exceptions
This content introduces the concept of exceptions in Java, focusing on their types and handling mechanisms.

Understanding Exceptions in Java

- An exception is an event that disrupts the normal flow of a program, often caused by errors like division by zero or accessing invalid array indices.
- Exceptions allow for graceful error handling, enabling programs to recover without crashing.

Types of Exceptions

- Checked exceptions are verified at compile time and must be handled using try-catch blocks or declared in method signatures.
- Unchecked exceptions occur at runtime, usually due to programming errors, and include issues like null pointer exceptions and arithmetic exceptions.

Handling Exceptions

- Java uses try, catch, and finally blocks for exception handling, where the try block contains code that may throw an exception, the catch block handles it, and the finally block executes cleanup code regardless of exceptions.
## Using Finally Block
This video lecture focuses on the use of finally blocks in Java's exception handling mechanism.

Understanding the Finally Block

- The finally block executes after the try and catch blocks, regardless of whether an exception occurred.
- It is primarily used for resource management, ensuring that resources like files or database connections are properly closed.

Correct Usage of Finally Block

- The finally block is essential for cleanup operations, such as closing files or database connections, to prevent resource leaks.
- It ensures that cleanup code runs even if an exception occurs in the try block.

Incorrect Usage of Finally Block

- Common mistakes include not handling exceptions that occur within the finally block, which can obscure the original exception.
- Using return statements in the finally block can lead to unexpected behavior, as it overrides any return values from the try or catch blocks.
## Using Multiple Try Catch
This content focuses on the concept of exception handling in Java, specifically using multiple try-catch blocks.

Understanding Try-Catch Exception Handling

- Java uses exceptions to manage errors, allowing programs to handle runtime issues without crashing.
- A try-catch block is structured to execute code that may throw an exception and to catch that exception if it occurs.

Multiple Try-Catch Blocks

- Multiple try-catch allows for handling different exceptions separately within the same block of code.
- This approach improves error handling clarity and enables specific responses based on the type of exception encountered.

Using the Throws Keyword

- The throws keyword in method declarations indicates that a method can throw one or more exceptions, informing the caller to handle them.
- This separation of concerns enhances code organization and encourages better error management practices.
## Checked and Runtime Exceptions Compared
This content focuses on understanding checked and runtime exceptions in Java.

Checked Exceptions

- Checked exceptions are verified at compile time, requiring the code to handle them before compilation.
- They are typically managed using try-catch blocks or declared in method signatures with the throws keyword, representing recoverable conditions like file not found.

Runtime Exceptions

- Runtime exceptions are not checked at compile time and occur during program execution, often due to programming errors.
- They do not need to be explicitly caught or declared, indicating issues like logic errors or improper API usage.

Comparison of Checked and Runtime Exceptions

- Checked exceptions are identified at compile time for external event recovery, while runtime exceptions signal programming errors that need fixing.
- Examples of checked exceptions include IOException and FileNotFoundException, whereas runtime exceptions include NullPointerException and ArithmeticException.
# Summary: Robust Exception Handling
Congratulations! You have completed this module. At this point, you know that:
- An exception disrupts the normal flow of a program but allows errors to be handled gracefully without crashing.
- Errors signal critical issues beyond the programmerâ€™s control and should be caught.
- Java has two types of exceptions:
- **Checked exceptions** are checked at compile-time.
- **Unchecked exceptions** are not checked at compile-time.
- Custom exception classes can be created by extending:
- **Exception** for checked exceptions.
- **RuntimeException** for unchecked exceptions.
- Java handles exceptions using **try, catch, and finally** blocks:
- The **try block** contains code that might throw an exception.
- The **catch block** handles the exception if it occurs.
- The **finally block** executes regardless of whether an exception occurred.
- Multiple try-catch blocks allow handling different exceptions separately.
- The **throws** keyword provides better error handling and separation of concerns.
- Best practices for the **finally block**:
- Always execute cleanup code, such as releasing database connections.
- Avoid return statements and unhandled exceptions.
