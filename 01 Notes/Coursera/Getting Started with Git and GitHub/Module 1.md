## Overview of Git and GitHub
This course item provides an overview of Git and GitHub, focusing on their roles in version control and collaboration.

Understanding Version Control
- Version control systems allow tracking changes to source code, making it easier to recover older versions and collaborate with team members.
- An example illustrates how version control helps manage contributions, like a shopping list, preventing confusion.

Introduction to Git
- Git is a distributed version control system (DVCS) that enables users worldwide to have copies of projects and sync changes to a remote server.
- It supports various file types and branching strategies, enhancing project organization and management.

Key Terms in Git and GitHub
- Important terms include repository (project folder), fork (copy of a repository), pull request (request for review), commit (snapshot of changes), branch (line of development), merge (combining changes), and clone (local copy of a repository).
## Introduction to GitHub
This content provides an overview of GitHub and its role in version control systems.

Understanding Git and GitHub
- Git is a distributed version-control system created by Linus Torvalds in 2005, primarily for tracking source code during development.
- GitHub serves as an online hosting service for Git repositories, allowing collaboration and version control for developers.

Key Features of Git
- Supports non-linear development and distributed workflows, enabling each developer to maintain a local copy of the full development history.
- Offers cryptographic authentication of history and pluggable merge strategies to manage complex integration decisions.

GitHub and Collaboration
- GitHub allows teams to collaborate effectively, manage access levels, and perform common Git operations through both web interfaces and local clients.
- It provides a platform for developers to create, review, and merge code, streamlining the development process and enhancing team productivity.
## GitHub Repositories
This content provides an overview of how to sign up for a GitHub account and create a repository.

Signing Up for GitHub
- Visit the GitHub website and choose a username, email, and password to create an account.
- Complete a verification test and confirm your email to finalize the account setup.

Creating a Repository
- A repository is a storage structure for code and related files, which can be public or private.
- When creating a repository, you can include a README file and a license to describe the project and its usage.

Understanding Repository Features
- The repository has several tabs: Code (for source files), Issues (to track project tasks), Pull Requests (for collaboration), and Projects (for project management).
- Additional features like Wiki, Security, and Insights are available for advanced users, while settings allow for personalization and access control.
## GitHub - Getting Started
This course item focuses on creating and managing repositories in GitHub.

Creating a New Repository
- Register for a GitHub account and log in.
- Provide a name, optional description, visibility (public or private), and choose to initialize with a README file before creating the repository.

Editing Files in the Repository
- Use the online editor to modify the README file and commit changes with a message.
- Create new files, such as a Python file, by providing a name, description, and code, then commit the changes.

Uploading Files
- Upload files from your local system by selecting the "Upload files" option and committing the changes once the upload is complete.
- Verify that the repository reflects the newly added files and any changes made.
## Summary: Getting Started with Git and GitHub
In this module, you learned that:

- Git is a versatile version control system used for tracking changes in code and collaborating with others on software projects.
- Due to a distributed version control system, Git enables you to revert to the previous state or review the projectâ€™s history.
- GitHub is one of the most popular web-hosted services for Git repositories.
- Repositories are storage structures that store documents, including application source code, and enable contributors to track and maintain version control.
- Git repository model
- Primarily focused on tracking source code during development.
- Contains elements to coordinate among programmers, track changes, and support non-linear workflows.
- Repositories are storage structures that can hold Code, track Issues, and enable you to collaborate with others.
- GitHub enables you to create repositories, edit files using the web interface, commit the changes to the file, upload the files, and a lot more.

# Branches with GitHub
## GitHub Branches
  
This content focuses on understanding branches in GitHub and how to manage code changes effectively.

Understanding GitHub Branches
- All files in GitHub are stored on branches, with the main branch being the definitive version of the code.
- New branches can be created for changes, starting as copies of the original branch, allowing for parallel development.

Managing Code Changes
- Developers commit changes to a branch, indicating a stable version of the code with meaningful comments.
- Pull requests are used to propose changes for review and merging into the main branch, requiring approval from team members.

Merging and Finalizing Changes
- Once changes are approved, they can be merged back into the main branch, and obsolete branches should be deleted.
- The process ensures that the main branch contains only the finalized, deployable code.
## Summary: Branches with GitHub

In this module, you learned that:

- A branch is a snapshot of your repository to which you can make changes.
- In the child branch, you can build, make edits, test the changes, and then merge them with the main branch.
- To ensure that changes are made by one member, do not impede or affect the workflow of other members, multiple branches can be created and merged with the main branch.
- A pull request is a way to notify other team members of the changes and edits made to the main branch.
