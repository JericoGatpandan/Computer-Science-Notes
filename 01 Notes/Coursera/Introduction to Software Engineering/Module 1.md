# Overview of Software Engineering
## What is Software Engineering?
- Software engineering is the systematic approach to design and development of software. 
- Responsibilities of a software engineer include: 
	- Designing, building, and maintaining software systems, 
	- writing and testing code
	- consulting with stakeholders, third party vendors, security specialists, and other team members. 
- And finally, software engineers build systems while software developers implement specific functionalities.

## Introduction to the SDLC
- The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a structured process used to develop high-quality software efficiently. Here’s a summary of its key points:
- Understanding the SDLC
	- The SDLC is a systematic approach to software development that includes planning, design, development, testing, and delivery.
	- It aims to produce software that meets business requirements within a predictable timeframe and budget.

- History and Evolution
	- The SDLC began in the mid-1960s to address the growing complexity of software development.
	- Initially, it used the "waterfall method," which follows a linear progression through distinct stages, but has since adapted to more iterative methods to better meet customer needs.

- Advantages of the SDLC
	- Provides a clear process for development teams, improving efficiency and reducing risks.
	- Each phase is well-defined, facilitating communication among team members and stakeholders.
	- Allows for iteration, enabling the incorporation of additional requirements as needed.
	- Early problem-solving helps address issues in the design phase rather than during coding.
	- Clearly defined roles for team members reduce conflicts and overlapping responsibilities.

## Phases of the SDLC
- The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) outlines the process of creating software through six distinct phases.
- Planning
	- Requirements are gathered, analyzed, and documented to understand what the software needs to achieve.
	- Factors like user needs, project scheduling, and resource allocation are considered.

- Design
	- The software architecture is developed based on the requirements, and a design document is created.
	- Prototypes may be made to visualize the system and gather feedback.

- Development
	- Developers begin coding based on the design document, using various programming tools and languages.
	- Coding tasks are assigned to team members to build the software.

- Testing
	- The software is thoroughly tested to ensure it is stable, secure, and meets the requirements.
	- Different testing levels, such as unit and integration testing, are conducted to identify and fix bugs.

- Deployment
	- The software is released to users, often starting with a user acceptance testing phase before full deployment.
	- It can be made available on various platforms like websites or app stores.

- Maintenance
	- After deployment, the software is monitored for bugs and user feedback is collected for improvements.
	- Any necessary updates or enhancements are identified, and the cycle may begin again for future releases.

## Building Quality Software
- The video lecture focuses on the common processes involved in building high-quality software.

- Software Engineering Processes
	- **Requirements Gathering**: This involves collecting and documenting what the software needs to do, including user needs and business requirements.
	- **Design**: This process transforms the requirements into a structured plan that developers can use to write the code, defining system architecture and components.

- Coding and Testing
	- **Coding for Quality**: This means writing code that is clean, maintainable, and meets the requirements without defects. It includes following coding standards and using tools to catch errors.
	- **Testing**: This verifies that the software works as intended and is free of bugs. It includes different levels of testing, such as unit testing and user acceptance testing.

- Releases and Documentation
	- **Releases**: Software goes through different stages before it is fully available, including alpha, beta, and general availability (GA) releases, each serving different purposes.
	- **Documentation**: This includes creating guides and manuals for both technical and non-technical users to help them understand and use the software effectively.

- Overall, these processes ensure that software is built to meet user needs and is of high quality.

## Requirements
- The requirement gathering process is essential in software development, consisting of several key steps to define and document what needs to be built.

- Identifying Stakeholders
	- Determine who will be affected by the software, including decision-makers and end-users.
	- Ensure representation from all relevant groups to gather diverse input.

- Establishing Goals and Objectives
	- Define broad, long-term goals for the software, such as customer satisfaction and business outcomes.
	- Set specific, measurable objectives that outline actionable steps to achieve these goals.

- Eliciting, Documenting, and Confirming Requirements
	- Gather requirements through methods like surveys and interviews.
	- Document the requirements clearly for understanding and alignment with goals.
	- Analyze and confirm the requirements for consistency and completeness before sharing with stakeholders.

- Prioritizing Requirements
	- Classify requirements into categories like "must-have," "highly desired," and "nice to have."
	- Order the requirements within these categories to guide development focus.

- Documentation Types
	- Software Requirements Specification (SRS): Details functionalities and performance benchmarks.
	- User Requirements Specification (URS): Captures user stories and expectations.
	- System Requirements Specification (SysRS): Outlines broader system capabilities and requirements.

- This process ensures that the software developed meets the needs and expectations of its users and stakeholders.

# The Software Building Process and Associated Role
## Software Development Methodologies
- The video lecture discusses three common software development methodologies: Waterfall, V-shape model, and Agile. Here’s a summary of the key points:

- Waterfall Method
	- A sequential approach where each phase must be completed before the next begins.
	- All planning is done upfront, and the customer typically sees the product only during testing.

- V-Shape Model
	- Similar to Waterfall but emphasizes verification and validation phases.
	- Each development phase corresponds with a testing phase, forming a V shape.

- Agile Method
	- An iterative approach focusing on collaboration and short development cycles called sprints.
	- Allows for ongoing feedback and adjustments, making it flexible to changing requirements.

- Comparison of Methods
	- Waterfall and V-shape are sequential and rigid, while Agile is cyclical and adaptable.
	- Agile is popular for its flexibility, but it can be challenging to plan resources compared to the more structured Waterfall and V-shape methods.

## Software Versions
- The topic of software versioning explains how software programs are labeled with version numbers to track their history of changes, updates, and fixes.

- Understanding Software Versioning
	- **Purpose of Version Numbers**: Version numbers help users and developers identify the specific state of a software program, indicating when it was released or updated.
	- **Format of Version Numbers**: Most version numbers consist of several parts separated by periods, such as "1.0" for the first release or "2.1.3" for subsequent updates. The numbers represent major changes, minor changes, patches, and build information.
	- **Semantic Versioning**: Some software follows a semantic numbering system, where the first number indicates major changes, the second indicates minor changes, the third indicates patches, and the fourth may indicate build details.
	- **Viewing Version Information**: Users can find their software version in the "About" or "Help" section of the application, which is useful for troubleshooting compatibility issues.
	- **Compatibility Issues**: Newer versions of software may not always be compatible with older versions, and checking version numbers can help resolve these issues.

## Software Testing
- The topic of **Software Testing** focuses on ensuring that software applications meet expected requirements and are free of errors. Here’s a summary of the key points:

- Types of Testing
	- **Functional Testing**: Checks if the software performs its intended functions correctly, focusing on inputs and outputs without looking at the internal code.
	- **Non-Functional Testing**: Evaluates aspects like performance, security, and usability, ensuring the software behaves well under various conditions.
	- **Regression Testing**: Confirms that recent changes (like bug fixes) do not negatively impact existing functionality.

- Testing Levels
	- **Unit Testing**: Tests individual sections of code to catch errors early in development.
	- **Integration Testing**: Identifies issues when combining multiple code modules.
	- **System Testing**: Validates the complete software product against specified requirements.
	- **Acceptance Testing**: Ensures the software meets user needs and business processes, typically conducted by customers or stakeholders.

- Overall, software testing is essential for delivering high-quality, reliable software products.

## Software Documentation
- The video lecture on Software Documentation provides an overview of the various types and purposes of documentation in software engineering.

- Types of Documentation
	- Documentation can be in three formats: written, video, or graphical.
	- It is categorized into product documentation (related to product functionality) and process documentation (describing how to complete tasks).

- Categories of Product Documentation
	- Requirements documentation outlines expected features and functionality for the development team.
	- Design documentation explains how the software will be built, while technical documentation includes comments and working papers to aid developers.

- Quality Assurance and User Documentation
	- Quality assurance documentation includes test plans and metrics related to the testing process.
	- User documentation is aimed at end-users, providing guides, FAQs, and manuals for operating the software.

- Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs)
	- SOPs are detailed instructions for specific organizational tasks, complementing process documentation.
	- They ensure that complex tasks are performed consistently and accurately within an organization.

- Importance of Keeping Documentation Updated
	- Documentation must be regularly updated to reflect changes in software, especially during the maintenance phase of the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC).
	- Periodic reviews are essential to maintain accuracy and relevance.

## Roles in Software Engineering Projects
- This content focuses on the various roles in software engineering projects and their responsibilities.

- Roles in Software Engineering Projects
	- **Project Manager/Scrum Master**: Ensures smooth project execution, focusing on planning, scheduling, and team communication. In Agile, the Scrum Master facilitates team success rather than just planning.
	- **Stakeholders**: Individuals for whom the product is designed, responsible for defining project requirements and providing feedback during development and testing phases.

- Software engineering is the application of scientific principles to the design and creation of software. 
- Responsibilities of a software engineer include designing, building, and maintaining software systems.  
- Using the SDLC can improve efficiency and reduce risks by:  
	- letting team members know what they should be working on and when  
	- facilitating communication between the customer, other stakeholders, and the development team 
	- letting stakeholders know where they fit into that process and  
	- letting cross-domain teams know when they have completed their tasks so development can move to the next phase.   
    
- Common software engineering processes are requirements gathering, design, coding, testing, releasing, and documenting. 
- The requirement gathering process entails identifying stakeholders, establishing goals thered, analyzed, and documented to understand what the software needs to achieve.and objectives, eliciting requirements from the stakeholders, documenting the requirements, analyzing, prioritizing, and confirming the requirements. 
- An SRS is a document that captures the functionalities that the software should perform and also establishes benchmarks or service levels for its performance. 
- A URS is a subset of the SRS that details user specification requirements. 
- The SysRS contains the same information as an SRS, but can also additionally include system capabilities, interfaces, and user characteristics, policy requirements, regulation requirements, personnel requirements, performance requirements, security requirements, and system acceptance criteria. 
- Waterfall, V-shape model, and agile are all different methodologies for implementing the software development life cycle. 
- Functional testing is concerned with inputs and corresponding outputs of the system under test, non-functional testing tests for attributes such as performance, security, scalability, and availability. Whereas regression testing confirms that a recent change to the application, such as a bug fix, does not adversely affect already existing functionality. 
- Types of documentation include requirements, design, technical, quality assurance, and user. 
- There are many different roles involved in a software engineering project. Some of them include project manager or scrum master, stakeholder, system or software architect, UX designer, software developer, tester or QA engineer, site reliability or Ops engineer, product manager or owner, and technical writer or information developer.
