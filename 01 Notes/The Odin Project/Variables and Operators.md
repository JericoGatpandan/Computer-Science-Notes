### ðŸ’¡ Key Ideas:
- What is Variable
- Basic JavaScript command to print something
- Assigning variable

### ðŸ—£ In my own words:
- Variable is like storage container that we can put data and call or use that data whenever we want.
- There are 3 ways to declare a variable in JavaScript: `let`, `const`, and `var`.
- `let` can be reassigned, while `const` cannot be reassigned.
- `var` is like let that can be reassigned and the original way of assigning a variable in java but it is not used anymore.
- We can print something to browser console using `console.log();`.
- `<script src="javascript.js"></script>` is how we can put JavaScript code in our website.
