# Idea: How to deploy or redeploy project in GitHub

"1. Make a new branch to deploy from by runningÂ `git branch gh-pages`. You only need to do this the first time you deploy. The rest of the steps should be done every time you deploy or redeploy your project. **only do if gh-pages branch is not yet created**
### This should be done every time I deploy or redeploy my project
1. Make sure you have all your work committed. You can useÂ `git status`Â to see if thereâ€™s anything that needs committing.
	1. RunÂ `git checkout gh-pages && git merge main --no-edit`Â to change branch and sync your changes fromÂ `main`Â so that youâ€™re ready to deploy.
2. Now letâ€™s bundle our application intoÂ `dist`Â with your build command. For now, thatâ€™sÂ `npx webpack`.
3. Now there are a few more commands. Run each of these in order:
    
    ```bash
    git add dist -f && git commit -m "Deployment commit"
    git subtree push --prefix dist origin gh-pages
    git checkout main
    ```
    
4. Recall that theÂ **source branch**Â for GitHub Pages is set in your repositoryâ€™s settings. Get this changed to theÂ `gh-pages`Â branch. That should be everything!
