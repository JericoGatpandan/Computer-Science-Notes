To apply **object-oriented programming (OOP)** in a project, you can follow these key steps:

1. **Identify Objects**:
    - Determine the main entities in your project. For example, in a library management system, objects could include `Book`, `Member`, and `Loan`.
2. **Define Classes**:
    - Create classes for each identified object. Each class should encapsulate attributes (data) and methods (functions) relevant to that object.

```js
class Book{
	 constructor(title, author){
		this.title = title;
	    this.author = author;
	 }
	   
	display_info() {
	 return `Title: ${this.title}, Author:${this.author}`;
	}      
}   
```
    
3. **Establish Relationships**:
    - Define how objects interact with each other. Use inheritance to create a hierarchy if needed. For example, you might have a `Member` class that inherits from a more general `User` class.
4. **[[Encapsulation]]**:
    - Keep the internal state of objects hidden from the outside. Use private attributes and provide public methods to access or modify them.
5. **[[Polymorphism]]**:
    
    - Allow methods to do different things based on the object calling them. For example, a method `borrow()` could behave differently for `Member` and `Admin` classes.
6. **Implement and Test**:
    
    - Write the code for your classes and methods, then test them to ensure they work as expected. Create instances of your classes and call their methods.
7. **Refine and Iterate**:
    - As you develop your project, refine your classes and relationships based on feedback and testing.

By following these steps, you can effectively implement OOP principles in your project, leading to more organized, maintainable, and scalable code.
