# Programming Languages and Organization
## Interpreted and Compiled Programming Languages
- This content provides an overview of interpreted and compiled programming languages, highlighting their characteristics and examples.

- Interpreted Programming Languages
	- These languages, such as Python and JavaScript, run through an interpreter that translates human-readable code into machine code.
	- They are often more versatile and easier to learn, making them suitable for tasks that require frequent execution.

- Compiled Programming Languages
	- Compiled languages, like C and Java, are transformed into executable files that run directly on devices, often used for more complex applications.
	- The compilation process converts source code into machine code, allowing for faster execution and repeated use.

- Key Differences
	- Interpreted languages are typically used for scripting and simpler tasks, while compiled languages are used for larger, more complex programs.
	- Each type has its own advantages, depending on the specific needs of the software being developed.

## Comparing Compiled and Interpreted Programming Languages
- This content focuses on comparing interpreted and compiled programming languages, highlighting their characteristics and use cases.

- Interpreted Programming Languages
	- These languages create scripted source code for smaller tasks and are executed line by line by an interpreter.
	- They are easier to learn and suitable for automating tasks, running on various operating systems with the appropriate interpreter.
- Compiled Programming Languages
	- These languages generate executable files that are grouped into programs, typically requiring more time to write but offering faster execution.
	- They are better suited for larger tasks, such as running complex applications, and are often specific to the operating system they are coded for.

- The main difference between interpreted and compiled languages lies in how they execute code:
	- **Interpreted Languages:**
		- **Execution:** Code is executed line by line by an interpreter at runtime.
		- **Use Case:** Ideal for smaller tasks and scripting, allowing for quick testing and iteration.
		- **Examples:** Python, JavaScript, and HTML.

	- **Compiled Languages:**
		- **Execution:** Code is translated into machine code by a compiler before execution, creating an executable file.
		- **Use Case:** Suitable for larger, more complex applications that require faster execution.
		- **Examples:** C, C++, and Java.

	- In summary, interpreted languages are generally easier to use and more flexible, while compiled languages offer better performance for larger programs.

## Query and Assembly Programming Languages
- The content focuses on understanding query and assembly programming languages, highlighting their differences and applications.

- High-Level vs. Low-Level Programming Languages
	- High-level programming languages use common English language constructs, making them easier to understand and code. Examples include SQL, Python, and Pascal.
	- Low-level programming languages, like assembly languages (e.g., ARM, MIPS), use symbols to represent machine code and are closely tied to specific hardware architectures.

- Query Languages
	- A query is a request for information from a database, requiring both the user application and the database to communicate in the same language.
	- SQL is the most widely used query language, but alternatives like AQL and Datalog also exist. Query languages are used for CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on databases.

- Assembly Languages
	- Assembly languages are simpler than high-level languages and translate directly to machine code instructions, with one assembly statement corresponding to one machine instruction.
	- Each CPU type typically has its own assembly language, and these languages are translated using an assembler rather than a compiler or interpreter.

## Understanding Code Organization and Methods
- This content focuses on the importance of code organization methods in programming.

- Code Organization Methods
	- Code organization is crucial for readability, maintainability, and scalability of software.
	- Well-planned software design leads to cleaner and more reliable code, reducing bugs and errors.

- Flowcharts
	- Flowcharts visually represent algorithms using shapes and arrows to indicate the order of steps.
	- They are beneficial for smaller concepts and serve as a good starting point for projects.

- Pseudocode
	- Pseudocode is a high-level description of algorithms that simplifies the coding process without strict syntax.
	- It helps programmers focus on logic and facilitates communication among team members, making it easier to modify and understand.

## Insiders' Viewpoint: Types of Languages
- The video lecture discusses the differences between compiled and interpreted programming languages, as well as the benefits of object-oriented programming compared to procedural programming.

- Compiled vs. Interpreted Languages
	- The choice between compiled and interpreted languages often comes down to personal preference and specific project needs.
	- Compiled languages may offer more predictable performance and deployment, while interpreted languages provide flexibility and creative possibilities.

- Object-Oriented vs. Procedural Programming
	- Object-oriented programming (OOP) allows for the creation of objects and hierarchies, making it easier to manage complex designs and interactions.
	- Procedural programming can feel more mathematical and engineering-focused, appealing to those who prefer a structured approach to coding.

- Overall, the discussion emphasizes the importance of understanding both programming paradigms and their respective advantages and disadvantages.

# Programming Logic and Concepts
## Branching and Looping Programming Logic
- The content focuses on the two major types of programming logic: branching and looping, which are essential for programming.

- Branching Logic
	- Branching allows a program to make decisions based on conditions, executing different instructions depending on whether certain criteria are met.
	- Common branching statements include if, if-then-else, switch, and GoTo, which control the flow of execution based on Boolean expressions.

- Looping Logic
	- Looping involves repeating a sequence of instructions until a specific condition is met, commonly used for processes like data retrieval and modification.
	- The three basic loop statements are While, For, and Do-while, each with distinct conditions for executing the loop body.

- Key Concepts
	- Boolean expressions evaluate to true or false, guiding the program's decision-making.
	- Variables hold values that can change, influencing the program's behavior based on user input or previous outputs.

## Introduction to Programming Concepts Part 1
- This content introduces fundamental programming concepts, focusing on identifiers and containers.

- Identifiers
	- Identifiers are custom-named labels used by software developers to reference program components like values, methods, interfaces, or classes.
	- There are two types of identifiers: **constants** (unchanging values) and **variables** (values that can change during execution).

- Containers
	- Containers allow referencing multiple elements without creating individual variables, enhancing efficiency.
	- The two main types of containers are **arrays** (fixed size, sequential order) and **vectors** (dynamic size, automatically resizing).
## Introduction to Programming Concepts Part 2
- This content focuses on the fundamental concepts of functions and objects in programming.

- Functions
	- [[Functions]] are modular components of code that perform specific tasks, allowing for code reuse and better organization.
	- There are two types of functions: standard library functions (built-in) and user-defined functions, which can be created by programmers.

- Objects
	- [[Object-oriented programming (OOP)]] emphasizes the use of objects, which encapsulate data (properties) and behaviors (methods).
	- Software objects are similar to real-world objects, consisting of states and behaviors, and they manage their own data structures.

# Summary & Highlights
- Congratulations! You have completed this module. At this point, you know: 
	- Interpreted programming languages create source code that runs through an interpreter and is built into your operating system (OS) on your computer or on your web browser. 
	- Compiled programming languages create executable files that are grouped in programs on your computer or device.  
	- Query languages, structured programming languages, and object-oriented programming languages are categorized as high-level programming languages and assembly languages are categorized as low-level programming languages.  
	- The two main methods of organizing and planning code are by developing flowcharts and by writing pseudocode. Flowcharts are pictorial representations of algorithms and pseudocode is an explanation of the function of each line of a program. 
	- To reference a program component, software developers use an identifier, which can either be a constant or a variable.  
	- A function is a piece of structured, stand-alone, and reusable code that will perform a single specific action.  
	- Object-oriented programming is a programming paradigm based on the concept of objects, which contain data and behavior through attributes and methods.
