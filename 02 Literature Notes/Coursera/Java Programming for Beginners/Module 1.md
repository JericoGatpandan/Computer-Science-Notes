	- It is widely used in web applications, mobile apps, and enterprise software due to its scalability and reliability.

- History of Java
	- Java originated in 1991 as Oak, developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems, and was renamed Java in 1995.
	- Significant versions include Java 2 (1998), which introduced GUI tools, and Java 5 (2004), which added generics and annotations. Java became open source in 2006, fostering community contributions.

- [[Java Key Features and Versions]]
	- Java 8 (2014) introduced lambda expressions and the Stream API for easier coding.
	- Java 11 (2018) improved memory management with a new garbage collector and added the HTTP Client API.
	- Java 17 (2021) introduced pattern matching and sealed classes, while Java 23 (2023) added features for concurrent programming and improved native code interaction.
## The Java Ecosystem
- The video lecture provides an overview of the Java ecosystem, highlighting its components and significance in software development.

- Java Ecosystem Overview
	- Java is a prominent programming language created by Sun Microsystems in 1995 and now owned by Oracle Corporation.
	- The ecosystem includes tools, libraries, frameworks, and platforms that enable developers to create robust applications.

- Core Components of the Java Ecosystem
	- The Java Development Kit (JDK) is essential for developers, consisting of the Java Compiler, Java Runtime Environment (JRE), and command-line utilities.
	- Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) like Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, and NetBeans enhance the development process with features such as code editing and debugging.

- Frameworks and Tools
	- Frameworks like Spring and Hibernate facilitate code reuse and accelerate development, while build tools like Maven and Gradle automate project management.
	- Application servers, such as Apache Tomcat and JBoss, provide environments for deploying Java applications, and testing frameworks like JUnit and TestNG ensure functionality through robust testing.
## The Java Virtual Machine, Development Kit, and Runtime Environment
- This content focuses on the three primary components of Java: the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), the Java Development Kit (JDK), and the Java Runtime Environment (JRE).

- [[Java Virtual Machine (JVM)]]
	- The JVM enables Java's platform independence by converting Java bytecode into machine code that the operating system can understand.
	- It manages memory through garbage collection, preventing memory leaks and ensuring smooth program execution.

- [[Java Development Kit (JDK)]]
	- The JDK is a comprehensive software package that includes the JRE and development tools necessary for building, compiling, and running Java applications.
	- It contains the Javac compiler, debuggers, and Java APIs, allowing developers to create a wide range of Java applications.

- [[Java Runtime Environment (JRE)]]
	- The JRE provides the essential environment to run Java applications, including the JVM and core libraries, but lacks development tools.
	- It allows Java programs to be executed without the need for the full JDK, making it lighter for running applications.

- Understanding these components is crucial for anyone working with Java, as they each play a distinct role in the development and execution of Java applications.
## Key Java Features
- This video lecture focuses on the key features of Java that contribute to its versatility, security, and efficiency.

- Object-Oriented Programming
	- Java uses objects to represent real-world entities, with classes defining properties and behaviors.
	- Inheritance allows classes to inherit features from other classes, while polymorphism enables actions to work differently based on the object.

- Core Features of Java
	- Platform independence is achieved through the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), allowing code to run on any system without modification.
	- Strong typing requires variable declaration with specific data types, enhancing code quality and reducing bugs.

- Memory Management and Multithreading
	- Automatic memory management through garbage collection prevents memory leaks by reclaiming unused memory.
	- Java supports multithreading, enabling multiple processes to run simultaneously for efficient application performance.

- Security and Versatility
	- Built-in security features protect against risks, while Java's comprehensive standard library provides tools for common tasks.
	- Java is widely used across various domains, including web and mobile development, and is increasingly popular for cloud-native applications and AI.
