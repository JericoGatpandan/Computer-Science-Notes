### ðŸ“– Summary:
-  Commands related to a remote repository:
Â  Â  - `git clone git@github.com:USER-NAME/REPOSITORY-NAME.git`
Â  Â  - `git push`Â orÂ `git push origin main`Â (Both accomplish the same goal in this context)

- Commands related to the workflow:
Â  Â  - `git add .`
Â  Â  - `git commit -m "A message describing what you have done to make this snapshot different"`
Â  Â 
- Commands related to checking status or log history
Â  Â  - `git status`
Â  Â  - `git log`

The basic Git syntax isÂ `program | action | destination`.

For example,
- `git add .`Â is read asÂ `git | add | .`, where the period represents everything in the current directory;
- `git commit -m "message"`Â is read asÂ `git | commit -m | "message"`; and
- `git status`Â is read asÂ `git | status | (no destination)`.
