# Idea: 3 Ways to declare variable in JavaScript

✍ Summary:
1. `let` - can be reassigned, common way to declare a variable.
2. `const` - "constant", cannot be reassigned will throw an error if we try.
3. `var` - like `let` can be reassigned but it is not common to use it anymore.

```JavaScript
let age = 11;
console.log(age);

const pi = 3.14; // Cannot be reassigned
console.log(pi); 
```
