# Idea: Rules of Inference in FOPL

✍ Summary:
- **UI** (Universal Instantiation): from ∀x P(x), infer P(a)
- **UG** (Universal Generalization): from P(a), infer ∀x P(x)
- **EI** (Existential Instantiation): from ∃x P(x), infer P(a) for new constant a
- **EG** (Existential Generalization): from P(a), infer ∃x P(x)
