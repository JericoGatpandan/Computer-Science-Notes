# Idea: Domain, Range, and Field

✍ Summary:
- **Domain (D(R))**: set of all first elements (x-values) in R.
- **Range (R(R))**: set of all second elements (y-values) in R.
- **Field (F(R))**: union of domain and range: D(R) ∪ R(R)

Example:  
R = {(2,4), (2,6), (3,3), (3,6)}  
D(R) = {2, 3}  
R(R) = {3, 4, 6}  
F(R) = {2, 3, 4, 6}
