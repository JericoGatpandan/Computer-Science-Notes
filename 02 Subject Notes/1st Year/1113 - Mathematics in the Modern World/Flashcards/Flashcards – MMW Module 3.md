## Q: What is inductive reasoning?
?
## A: Reasoning based on patterns and specific examples that lead to a general conclusion.

---

## Q: What is deductive reasoning?
?
## A: Reasoning that applies general rules or principles to arrive at a specific conclusion.

---

## Q: Predict the next number: 21, 24, 27, 30, 33...
?

## A: The product is always an even number.

---

## Q: What reasoning is used to prove a process always gives 3n?
?
## A: Deductive reasoning (applying algebraic steps to prove the result).

---

## Q: What kind of reasoning is used in logic puzzles?

## Q: What happens when you apply this process: Multiply n by 9, add 12, divide by 3, then subtract 4?
?
## A: The result is always 3n.
