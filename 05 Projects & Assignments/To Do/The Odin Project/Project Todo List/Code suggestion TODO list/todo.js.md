Great ‚Äî this is your **Todo entity module**, and it‚Äôs the core data model of your app. Let's review it in terms of **clean code** and **SOLID principles**.

---

## ‚úÖ What‚Äôs Good

- Uses `uuid` for unique IDs ‚Äì ‚úÖ good practice.
    
- Separates data (via class) from the UI ‚Äì ‚úÖ good separation of concerns.
    
- `edit()` accepts an object, so it's flexible ‚Äì ‚úÖ extensible.

## üßπ Clean Code Suggestions

### 1. ‚ùå Unused `ID` parameter in constructor

```js
constructor(title, description, dueDate, priority, completed = false, ID)
```

You're generating a new UUID no matter what. The `ID` parameter is **useless**. Remove it:

```js
constructor(title, description, dueDate, priority, completed = false) {
  this.ID = uuidv4();
}
```

### 2. ‚úÖ Use default values for constructor fields

If many values are optional (like `description` or `priority`), consider defaulting them:

```js
constructor(title, description = "", dueDate = null, priority = "low", completed = false)
```

### 3. ‚ö†Ô∏è Method name `toggleCompleted()` doesn't toggle

You have:

```js
toggleCompleted() {
  this.completed = true;
}
```

This isn't _toggling_, it's _setting_. Rename it to `markAsCompleted()` **or** make it truly toggle:

```js
toggleCompleted() {
  this.completed = !this.completed;
}
```

## üß† SOLID Principle Suggestions

|Principle|Status|Notes|
|---|---|---|
|SRP|‚ö†Ô∏è Mostly OK|`Todo` is both a data holder _and_ editor. Consider separating editing logic (optional).|
|OCP|‚ö†Ô∏è OK for now|Can be extended, but future-proofing would mean no changes to core class when new logic arises.|
|LSP|‚úÖ Yes|No subclass yet, but it‚Äôs substitutable if extended properly.|
|ISP|‚úÖ N/A|No interfaces yet.|
|DIP|‚ùå No|This class depends on the concrete `uuid` library. Can be inverted via ID provider injection (advanced).|

## üîÅ Suggested Refactor

```js
import { v4 as uuidv4 } from "uuid";

export class Todo {
  constructor(title, description = "", dueDate = null, priority = "low", completed = false) {
    this.title = title;
    this.description = description;
    this.dueDate = dueDate;
    this.priority = priority;
    this.completed = completed;
    this.ID = uuidv4();
  }

  toggleCompleted() {
    this.completed = !this.completed;
  }

  edit({ title, description, dueDate, priority, completed }) {
    if (title !== undefined) this.title = title;
    if (description !== undefined) this.description = description;
    if (dueDate !== undefined) this.dueDate = dueDate;
    if (priority !== undefined) this.priority = priority;
    if (completed !== undefined) this.completed = completed;
  }
}

export function createTodo(title, description, dueDate, priority, completed) {
  return new Todo(title, description, dueDate, priority, completed);
}
```

---

### üß™ (Optional for SOLID) ‚Äì Inject UUID generator

To follow **Dependency Inversion**, we can pass the ID generator from outside:

```js
export class Todo {
  constructor(title, description, dueDate, priority, completed, idGenerator = uuidv4) {
    this.title = title;
    ...
    this.ID = idGenerator();
  }
}
```

This allows you to replace `uuidv4()` with a mock or a custom generator ‚Äî useful in tests or alternative designs.
