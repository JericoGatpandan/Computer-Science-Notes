## 🧱 APP IDEA: **“MatSearch PH” – Construction Material Price & Store Finder**

### 🚧 Problem:

Engineers, contractors, and even homeowners waste **hours calling or driving around** hardware stores to:

- Find out **if a material is in stock**
- **Compare prices**
- Get **supplier contact info or location**

There’s **no centralized app** to search “10mm rebar” and instantly see stores near you selling it.
