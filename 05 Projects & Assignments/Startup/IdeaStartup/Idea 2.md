## **Project Title: ALERTO+ GOV-LINK**

**A Smart Household Flood Alert System with Automatic Escalation and Human Confirmation**

---

### **Project Summary:**

**ALERTO+ GOV-LINK** is an innovative, tech-enabled flood warning system designed for households in flood-prone areas. It combines **automated flood detection** with **human-centered emergency communication** to ensure faster, smarter disaster response.

The system uses a **sensor-based device** (or manual button) installed in homes. When it detects a rising water level or when pressed by a resident:

1. It **triggers an alarm** inside the house.
2. It **sends an alert with GPS location** to the user’s family, barangay officials, and emergency responders.
3. The system then **automatically notifies higher authorities**, such as the City Disaster Risk Reduction Office.
4. Upon receiving the alert, **authorities can initiate a confirmation check** by:
    - **Chatting, texting, or calling** the resident
    - Contacting a **barangay official or family member** in that area
    - **Visually reviewing the situation** if connected to a camera or dashboard
This added layer of human confirmation helps **filter false alarms** while ensuring that **critical alerts are acted upon immediately.**

### **Key Features:**

- 🚨 **Auto-alert** via water level sensor or manual button
- 📍 **Real-time GPS-based notifications** sent to key responders
- 📱 **2-way communication** with authorities via app, SMS, or call
- 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 **Verification process**: higher authorities can check or message households to confirm the situation
- 🔋 **Offline-capable**: Works even during blackouts using solar power and SMS fallback
- 🏘️ **Scalable solution** for communities, especially in typhoon-prone zones

### 🎯 **Why It’s Important:**

ALERTO+ GOV-LINK doesn't just detect danger—it starts a **response conversation** between households and government. By combining **smart detection** with **human verification**, it reduces panic, ensures accuracy, and enables **faster, data-driven rescue operations**.
This project supports Naga City's mission to build a **next-generation, resilient flood response system**, as part of the **Bloomberg Challenge 2025**.
