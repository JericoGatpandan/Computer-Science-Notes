## **Project Title: ALERTO+ GOV-LINK**

**A Smart, Community-Based Flood Alert and Emergency Escalation System**

---

### **Project Summary:**

**ALERTO+ GOV-LINK** is a **mobile app-based flood warning system** that empowers households and communities to respond quickly during floods or typhoons. It uses a **smart sensor or manual button** that, when pressed or triggered by rising water levels, immediately:

1. **Sounds a local alarm** in the household,
2. **Notifies nearby family members and barangay officials** through app alerts and SMS,
3. **Automatically escalates to higher authorities** (City Disaster Risk Reduction Office, NDRRMC, or emergency responders) if multiple alerts occur in the same area or if a critical danger level is detected.

The app allows **two-way communication** with authorities, **shares GPS location**, and enables real-time updates and rescue coordination. It is designed to work even in low-connectivity areas using SMS fallback and solar-powered trigger devices.

### **Key Features:**

- One-tap emergency alert via app or physical device
- Automatic detection of rising water through sensors
- Instant alarm + GPS location sent to barangay and city officials
- Escalates alerts if multiple households are affected
- Built-in chat or call system between citizens and responders
- Works offline using SMS backup
- Scalable and low-cost for mass deployment

### **Why It Matters:**

ALERTO+ GOV-LINK brings **life-saving flood alerts directly to the household**, while ensuring **city-level responders are informed in real time**. It combines **smart technology**, **community involvement**, and **government response** into one systemâ€”designed for **fast deployment**, **low cost**, and **maximum impact** during disasters.
