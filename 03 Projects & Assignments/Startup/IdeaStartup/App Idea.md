## 🔹 1) **Typhoon and Flood Warning Systems**

### 💡 **AI-Based Rainfall & Flood Forecasting App**

- Uses real-time data from open weather APIs (like OpenWeather or PAGASA) + historical flood data.
    
- Applies **machine learning** to predict the likelihood and severity of flood per barangay.
    
- Sends personalized alerts to residents with instructions (e.g., "prepare", "evacuate", "safe").
    

### 💡 **Community SMS A lert System (for areas with poor internet)**

- Auto-sends warning messages via SMS to registered residents and barangay leaders.
    
- Works with a basic GSM modem or cloud-based SMS services (Twilio, Globe Labs).
    

### 💡 **Low-Cost Solar-Powered Weather Station**

- Measures rainfall, wind speed, and pressure using Arduino or Raspberry Pi.
    
- Installs in schools/barangay halls and uploads data online or via SMS.

## 🔹 2) **River Watershed Monitoring Solutions**

### 💡 **IoT Water Level Monitoring System**

- Installs ultrasonic or float sensors in rivers/watersheds to measure water level.
    
- Sends real-time updates to the cloud dashboard or text alert if water rises rapidly.
    
- Use LoRa or GSM for data transmission even in remote areas.
    

### 💡 **Drone-Based River Scanning**

- Program a cheap drone with a camera or infrared sensor to scan watersheds and riverbanks regularly.
    
- AI processes images to detect possible blockages, landslides, or erosion.
    

### 💡 **Community-Centered Watershed Reporting App**

- Residents report sightings (e.g., river overflow, blocked canals, illegal dumping).
    
- App collects geotagged reports, helps prioritize response areas.

## 🔹 3) **Flood Warning Public Address Systems**

### 💡 **Smart PA System with Trigger Alerts**

- Build PA systems that auto-broadcast warnings when water sensors are triggered.
    
- Can be solar-powered + battery backup for brownouts.
    
- Uses pre-recorded multilingual messages (Bicolano, Tagalog, English).
    

### 💡 **Voice-Activated Barangay Alert System**

- Each barangay has a megaphone system that responds to voice commands (e.g., “Code Red Alert”).
    
- Can be triggered remotely by LGU or auto-triggered via API from central monitoring app.
    

### 💡 **Barangay Warning Network using Walkie-Talkie + PA**

- Equips barangay personnel with radio-based walkie-talkies connected to PA horns.
    
- Fast manual relay for voice warnings when systems or power are down.

## Bonus 🔧 **Cross-Cutting Ideas (for any category)**

- **Color-coded flood indicator poles** along rivers (combined with sensors or manually updated)
    
- **Gamified disaster preparedness app** for schools and households (learn + practice emergency response)
    
- **"Adopt-a-Drain" community platform** where volunteers monitor key waterways and receive rewards
    
- **Offline-ready apps** for senior citizens or low-tech phones (via SMS or USSD menu system)
