## 🎯 Goal / Task
> Create a game Rock Paper Scissors in console
> 	This Game will be played against computer
> 	Write a function that randomly returns "rock", "paper", "scissors"
> 	1. Create a new function named `getComputerChoice`.
> 	2. Write the code so that `getComputerChoice` will randomly `return` one of the following string values: “rock”, “paper” or “scissors”. **Use Math.random**
> 	
> 	Your game will be played by a human player. You will write a function that takes the user choice and returns it. 
> 	3. Create a new function named `getHumanChoice`
> 	4. Write the code so that `getHumanChoice` will return one of the valid choices depending on what the user inputs.
> 
> 	Your game will keep track of the players score. You will write variables to keep track of the players score.
> 	5. Create two new variables named `humanScore` and `computerScore` in the global scope.
> 	6. Initialize those variables with the value of `0`.
> 
>	Your game will be played round by round. You will write a function that takes the human and computer player choices as arguments, plays a single round, increments the round winner’s score and logs a winner announcement.
>	7. Create a new function named `playRound`.
>	8. Define two parameters for `playRound`: `humanChoice` and `computerChoice`. Use these two parameters to take the human and computer choices as arguments.
>	9. Make your function’s `humanChoice` parameter case-insensitive so that players can input “rock”, “ROCK”, “RocK”, or other variations.
>	10. Write the code for your `playRound` function to `console.log` a string value representing the round winner, such as: “You lose! Paper beats Rock”.
>	11. Increment the `humanScore` or `computerScore` variable based on the round winner.
>
>	Your game will play 5 rounds. You will write a function named `playGame` that calls `playRound` to play 5 rounds, keeps track of the scores and declares a winner at the end.
>	12. Create a new function named `playGame`.
>	13. Move your `playRound` function and score variables so that they’re declared inside of the new `playGame` function
>	14. Play 5 rounds by calling `playRound` 5 times.
		- **Hint**: When you assign a function call to a variable, the return value of that function is assigned to the variable. Accessing the variable afterward will only provide the assigned value; it doesn’t recall the function. You need to recall the choice functions to get new choices for each round.
		- Re-work your previous functions or create more helper functions if necessary. Specifically, you may want to change the return values to something more useful.
		- If you already know about loops, you can use them. If not, don’t worry! Loops will be covered in the next lesson.
