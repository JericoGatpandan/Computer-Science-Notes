## Business Rules
- A statement that defines or contains some aspect of the business.
- A brief, precise and unambiguous description of a policy, procedure or principle within a specific organization
	- Examples :
		Enrollment System, Sales System.
- "business rules and policies are not universal"
- "business rules may change overtime"
	- A business rule is a statement of a policy, not how the policy is enforced or conducted; the rules does not describe a process or implementation, **but rather describes what a process validates.**
