## Q: What is the Cartesian product A × B?
?
## A: The set of ordered pairs {(x, y) | x ∈ A and y ∈ B}

---

## Q: What makes a relation a function?
?
## A: Every element in the domain has exactly one output in the range.

---

## Q: What is the domain of a relation R?
?
## A: All first elements (x-values) of the ordered pairs in R.

---

## Q: What is the range of a relation R?
?
## A: All second elements (y-values) of the ordered pairs in R.

---

## Q: What is the field of a relation R?
?
## A: The union of domain and range: F(R) = D(R) ∪ R(R)

---

## Q: Define a reflexive relation.
?
## A: A relation R is reflexive if (a, a) ∈ R for every a ∈ A.

---

## Q: Define an irreflexive relation.
?
## A: A relation R is irreflexive if (a, a) ∉ R for every a ∈ A.

---

## Q: What makes a relation symmetric?
?
## A: If (a, b) ∈ R, then (b, a) must also be in R.

---

## Q: What makes a relation asymmetric?
?
## A: If (a, b) ∈ R, then (b, a) must NOT be in R.

---

## Q: What makes a relation antisymmetric?
?
## A: If (a, b) ∈ R and (b, a) ∈ R, then a must equal b.

---

## Q: What makes a relation transitive?
?
## A: If (a, b) ∈ R and (b, c) ∈ R, then (a, c) ∈ R.
