# Idea: Cartesian Product and Relations

✍ Summary:
- The Cartesian Product of sets A and B is:  
  A × B = {(x, y) | x ∈ A and y ∈ B}
- It is **not commutative**: A × B ≠ B × A in general.
- A **relation** R from A to B is any subset of A × B.
- Cardinality: If |A| = m and |B| = n, then |A × B| = m × n
