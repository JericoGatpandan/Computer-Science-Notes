ðŸ“– Summary:
### Early Calculating Devices

- Fingers, tally sticks, counting rods, abacus (2700-2300 BC)
- Slide Ruler (1620) - for multiplication and division
- Pascaline (1642) - first mechanical calculator for addition and subtraction

### Pre-Electronic Era

- Mathematical tables created by human 'computers'
- Charles Babbage (1820s) - Difference Engine and Analytical Engine
- Ada Lovelace - wrote first algorithm for Analytical Engine

### Punch Cards Era

- Herman Hollerith (1887) - introduced punch cards for census data
