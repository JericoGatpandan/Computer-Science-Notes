üìñ Summary:
#### What is Computer?

- ‚Äúcompute‚Äù == ‚Äúto calculate‚Äù
- A computer is an electronic device that can perform
  arithmetic operations at high speed.
- A computer is also called a data processor because it
  can store, process, and retrieve data whenever desired.

- Data Processing

  DATA (Unorganized) ‚Üí Capture Data ‚Üí Manipulate Data ‚Üí Output Results ‚Üí INFORMATION (Organized Data)

  - **CPU (Central Processing Unit):** The brain of the computer,
    responsible for executing instructions.

    What is the Two main parts of a CPU:

    - **Arithmetic logic unit (ALU) ‚Üí** which performs simple arithmetic and logical operations.
    - **Control unit (CU)**, which manages the various components of the computer.

  - **Memory:** Stores data and instructions for the CPU to access.
  - **Storage:** Stores data persistently, even when the computer is
    turned off (e.g., hard drives, SSDs).

  - **Input/output devices:** Allow interaction with the computer
    (e.g., keyboard, mouse, monitor, printer).

  - **Desktop computers:** Powerful computers for general use.
  - **Laptops:** Portable computers with integrated keyboard and
    display.

  - **Servers:** Computers designed to provide services to other
    computers (e.g., web servers, email servers).

  - **Supercomputers:** Extremely powerful computers used for
    complex calculations and simulations.

  - **LAN (Local Area Network):** Connects computers within a
    limited area (e.g., office, home).

  - **WAN (Wide Area Network):** Connects computers across
    a large geographic area (e.g., the internet).

  - **MAN (Metropolitan Area Network):** Connects computers
    within a city or metropolitan area.

  - **Operating systems:** Manage computer hardware and
    software resources (e.g., Windows, macOS, Linux).

  - **Application software:** Performs specific tasks for users
    (e.g., word processors, spreadsheets, games).

  - **Programming languages:** Used to create software (e.g.,
    Python, Java, C++).
