**What Can You Automate with npm Scripts?**

Here are some common tasks that can be automated using package JSON scripts in Node.js or npm scripts:

- **Running a linter**: Check your code for errors or enforce coding standards.
- **Starting a development server**: Launch your application in a local environment.
- **Minifying** [**JavaScript**](https://www.upgrad.com/tutorials/software-engineering/javascript-tutorial/) **or** [**CSS**](https://www.upgrad.com/blog/css-tutorial-learn-css-from-scratch/): Optimize assets for production.
- **Running tests**: Execute unit or integration tests.
- **Building a project**: Compile code from modern JavaScript (e.g., ES6+) to older versions.
- **Cleaning up builds**: Remove temporary or old files.

**How to Define and Run npm Scripts:**

To define a script, add it under the "scripts" section in your package.json file:

```
{
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node app.js",
    "lint": "eslint .",
    "build": "webpack --mode production",
    "test": "jest",
    "clean": "rm -rf dist/"
  }
}
```

**Running npm Scripts:**

To execute a script, use the following command in your terminal:

```
npm run <script-name>
```

For example:

```
npm run start    # Runs the "start" script (starts the server)
npm run lint     # Runs the "lint" script (checks code with ESLint)
npm run build    # Runs the "build" script (compiles and minifies code)
```

You can run the start script with just npm start (no run required) for convenience.

By leveraging package.json scripts, you can simplify development workflows, reduce the chances of errors, and ensure that tasks are performed consistently.

In the next section, you will learn about the important package JSON scripts for Node.js projects.

## Essential Package JSON Scripts for Node.js Projects

In Node.js, defining scripts in package.json simplifies project workflows. Here are essential scripts every developer should know:

**Common Scripts**

- start: Launches the server or application.
- test: Executes test cases for your project.
- build: Compiles and prepares production-ready code.
- dev: Starts a development server with live reload or debugging.
- lint: Enforces code style guidelines by running a linter.

**Additional Scripts**:

- clean: Removes build artifacts or temporary files.
- deploy: Deploys the application to a server or cloud.

Example package.json Scripts:

```
{
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node app.js",
    "dev": "nodemon app.js",
    "test": "jest",
    "build": "webpack --mode production",
    "lint": "eslint .",
    "clean": "rm -rf dist/",
    "deploy": "scp -r dist/ user@server:/var/www/project"
  }
}
```

**Running These Scripts**

Use the npm run <script-name> command to execute a script. For instance:

```
npm run dev    # Starts the development server
npm run test   # Runs tests
npm run build  # Builds the project
npm run clean  # Cleans up old build files
```

You'll now have a look at the pre and post scripts in Node.js.

### Exploring Pre and Post Scripts in Node.js

Pre and post scripts allow you to define tasks that run automatically before or after a specific npm script.

**How Pre and Post Scripts Work**

- Add pre or post as a prefix to an existing script name.
- pre scripts run before the main script.
- post scripts run after the main script.

Example Scenarios:

- Run a linter before starting the server.
- Clean up old logs before running tests.

Example package.json Pre/Post Scripts:

```
{
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node app.js",
    "prestart": "npm run lint",
    "posttest": "rm -rf logs/"
  }
}
```

Running Pre/Post Scripts:

- Running npm start automatically executes prestart → start.
- Running npm test triggers the test script, followed by posttest.
```
npm start    # Executes linting before starting the server
npm test     # Runs tests, then cleans logs
```

Let’s now have a look at the life cycle scripts in Node.js.

### Understanding Life Cycle Scripts in Node.js

Life cycle scripts are triggered during key stages of the application workflow. Examples include:

- prestart: Runs before the start script.
- poststart: Runs after the start script.

Use Case Examples:

- **Build and Clean Process:**
	- prestart: Compile code before starting the application.
	- poststart: Log startup metrics.

**Benefits of Life Cycle Scripts:**

- Automates repetitive tasks.
- Ensures smooth workflows by sequencing actions during application execution.

Example package.json with Life Cycle Scripts:

```
{
  "scripts": {
    "prestart": "npm run build",
    "start": "node app.js",
    "poststart": "echo 'Server started successfully!'",
    "pretest": "npm run clean",
    "test": "jest",
    "posttest": "npm run lint"
  }
}
```

**How It Works:**

Running npm start executes the following in order:

1\. prestart → Build the project.

2\. start → Start the application.

3\. poststart → Display a success message.

```
npm start
# Output:
# Build completed.
# Server is running...
# Server started successfully!
```

By using these scripts, you can automate complex workflows, improve efficiency, and maintain consistency in your Node.js projects.

In the next section, you will learn how to create custom package JSON scripts.

## Step-by-Step Guide to Creating Custom Package JSON Scripts

Creating custom npm scripts allows you to automate repetitive tasks and streamline workflows in Node.js projects. This section will walk you through defining and managing custom scripts for efficient development.

### Passing Arguments to Scripts

Npm scripts can accept arguments, making them flexible for dynamic tasks. Arguments are passed after -- in the command.

**Steps to Pass Arguments:**

1\. Define a script in package.json that references a Node.js file or command.

2\. Pass arguments during script execution with npm run.

Example:

package.json Script:

```
{
  "scripts": {
    "greet": "node greet.js"
  }
}
```

greet.js:

```
const name = process.argv[2];
console.log(\`Hello, ${name || 'World'}!\`);
```

Running the Script:

```
npm run greet -- John
# Output: Hello, John!
```

Example of Adding Custom Scripts:

Custom scripts simplify tasks with descriptive names.

**Steps to Add Custom Scripts**

Add the script under the "scripts" section in package.json.

Define the command or script to execute.

Example:

package.json Script:

```
{
  "scripts": {
    "my-custom-script": "node my-script.js"
  }
}
```

my-script.js:

```
console.log('This is my custom script!');
```

Running the Script:

```
npm run my-custom-script
# Output: This is my custom script!
```

Let’s now have a look at how you can run multiple scripts in parallel for your package JSON scripts in Node.js projects.

### Running Multiple Scripts in Parallel

To execute multiple scripts simultaneously, use tools like npm-run-all or custom solutions with &.

Using npm-run-all

Install npm-run-all:

```
npm install npm-run-all --save-dev
```

Define combined scripts in package.json:

```
{
  "scripts": {
    "lint": "eslint .",
    "test": "jest",
    "build": "webpack --mode production",
    "start-all": "npm-run-all --parallel lint test build"
  }
}
```

Run the combined script:

```
npm run start-all
# Executes lint, test, and build scripts in parallel.
```

Example with Native Parallel Execution

Without external tools, use & to run scripts in parallel:

```
{
  "scripts": {
    "parallel-tasks": "npm run lint & npm run test"
  }
}
```

Run the script:

```
npm run parallel-tasks
# Runs lint and test scripts simultaneously.
```

By defining custom scripts, passing arguments, and combining tasks, you can significantly improve workflow automation in your Node.js projects.

This next section will introduce you to working with user and environment variables while working with package JSON scripts in Node.js.

## Working with User and Environment Variables in Scripts

Handling user permissions, environment variables, and exit codes effectively within npm scripts ensures smoother workflows and robust task automation. Here's a breakdown of these aspects and how to manage them.

**User: Running Scripts with Root Privileges**

Certain scripts may require elevated permissions, such as modifying system files or accessing restricted resources. Use tools to manage privileges securely.

Best Practices for Running Scripts as Root:

- Avoid running scripts as root unless absolutely necessary to prevent security risks.
- Use tools like sudo or run scripts with appropriate user permissions.

Example:

Run a script requiring elevated permissions:

```
{
  "scripts": {
    "update-system": "sudo apt-get update"
  }
}
```

Command to execute:

```
npm run update-system
# Prompts for root password if necessary.
```

**Environment: Accessing Environment Variables and System Info**

Environment variables allow you to pass dynamic data to scripts, making them adaptable across different systems or configurations.

Accessing Environment Variables:

- Use process.env.<VARIABLE\_NAME> in Node.js scripts.
- Pass variables inline when running the script.

Example:

Define a script in package.json:

```
{
  "scripts": {
    "show-env": "node show-env.js"
  }
}
```

Create show-env.js:

```
console.log(\`Current Environment: ${process.env.NODE_ENV || 'development'}\`);
console.log(\`API Key: ${process.env.API_KEY || 'Not Set'}\`);
```

Run with variables:

```
NODE_ENV=production API_KEY=12345 npm run show-env
# Output:
# Current Environment: production
# API Key: 12345
```

**Cross-Platform Variables:**

Use cross-env for compatibility across systems:

```
npm install cross-env --save-dev
```

Example:

```
{
  "scripts": {
    "start-prod": "cross-env NODE_ENV=production node app.js"
  }
}
```

**Exit Codes: Understanding Script Exit Codes**

Exit codes indicate whether a script ran successfully or encountered an error. npm interprets these codes to determine script behavior.

**How Exit Codes Work:**

- **Exit code** 0: Success.
- **Non-zero codes**: Error or failure.
- npm halts subsequent scripts in a sequence if a non-zero exit code is encountered.

Example:

A script returning an error:

```
{
  "scripts": {
    "fail-test": "node fail-test.js"
  }
}
```

Create fail-test.js:

```
console.error('An error occurred.');
process.exit(1);
```

Run the script:

```
npm run fail-test
# Output:
# An error occurred.
# Script exits with code 1, signaling failure.
```

Using || for Default Behavior:

Define fallback actions for failed scripts:

```
{
  "scripts": {
    "test-or-build": "npm run test || npm run build"
  }
}
```

Run the script:

```
npm run test-or-build
# If 'test' fails, 'build' runs as a fallback.
```

By effectively managing user permissions, leveraging environment variables, and handling exit codes, you can create robust and flexible npm scripts that adapt to varying needs and scenarios.

Let's now have a look at the ways to enhance the NPM script options to optimize efficiency.

## How to Enhance NPM Script Options for Maximum Efficiency?

Enhancing npm scripts with flags and arguments makes them more versatile and powerful. These features allow scripts to handle dynamic input, control execution, and customize behaviours based on your needs.

**Passing Arguments to Scripts**

Package JSON scripts in Node.js projects can accept additional flags and arguments, making them more flexible for different use cases. Arguments are passed after a -- in the command.

**How to Pass Arguments:**

- Add -- after the script name in the terminal, followed by the arguments or flags.
- Access these arguments using process.argv in your Node.js scripts.

Example 1: Running Tests with Arguments

Define a script in package.json:

```
{
  "scripts": {
    "test": "jest"
  }
}
```

Run the script with arguments:

```
npm run test -- --onlyChanged
# Jest runs only tests for changed files.
```

Example 2: Dynamic Greeting Script

Define a script in package.json:

```
{
  "scripts": {
    "greet": "node greet.js"
  }
}
```

Create greet.js:

```
const name = process.argv[2];
console.log(\`Hello, ${name || 'World'}!\`);
```

Run with a custom argument:

```
npm run greet -- John
# Output: Hello, John!
```

Examples: Running Commands with Options:

Npm scripts can also save outputs or modify execution behavior using flags.

Example 1: Save Linter Output to a File

Define a lint script:

```
{
  "scripts": {
    "lint": "eslint ."
  }
}
```

Run the script and redirect output:

```
npm run lint -- -f json > lint-results.json
# Saves ESLint results in JSON format to a file.
```

Example 2: Run Scripts in Watch Mode:

Enable live updates during development:

```
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "webpack --watch"
  }
}
```

Run the development server with watch mode:

```
npm run dev
# Automatically rebuilds when changes are detected.
```

**Benefits of Enhancing Script Options:**

- **Dynamic Execution**: Customize behavior without editing the script.
- **Increased Productivity**: Save time with reusable and adaptable commands.
- **Improved Debugging**: Output results to files or logs for analysis.

By using arguments and flags in package JSON scripts in Node.js, you can create efficient workflows tailored to your specific project needs.

## How to Effectively Manage Your Node.js package.json File?

Keeping your package.json file organized is crucial for maintaining a functional and scalable Node.js project. It acts as the central hub for managing dependencies, scripts, and metadata about your application. Here's a guide to effectively manage and optimize your package.json file.

**Steps to Manage package.json Efficiently**

**1\. Initialize package.json Using npm**

Use the npm init command to create a structured and well-documented package.json file.

```
npm init
# Follow the prompts to fill out details like name, version, and description.
```

**2\. Manage Dependencies Properly**

Use npm commands to add, update, or remove dependencies:

- Add a dependency:
```
npm install <package-name>
```
- Add a development-only dependency:
```
npm install <package-name> --save-dev
```
- Remove a dependency:
```
npm uninstall <package-name>
```

**3\. Synchronize package.json and node\_modules/**

Ensure consistency between the package.json file and the installed packages in node\_modules/. Run the following:

```
npm install
```

This checks package.json and installs missing dependencies or updates node\_modules/.

**4\. Use npm CLI for Safe Management**

Use npm CLI commands for better control and reliability:

- Update all packages:
```
npm update
```
- Audit for vulnerabilities:
```
npm audit
```
- Clean unused dependencies:
```
npm prune
```

Organized package.json Example:

| **Section** | **Purpose** | **Example** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **name** | Name of your project. | "name": "my-node-app" |
| **version** | Versioning for updates. | "version": "1.0.0" |
| **dependencies** | Required packages for runtime. | "express": "^4.17.1" |
| **devDependencies** | Tools for development only. | "eslint": "^7.32.0" |
| **scripts** | Custom commands to automate tasks. | "start": "node app.js", "test": "jest" |
| **main** | Entry point of your application. | "main": "index.js" |
| **license** | License information for your project. | "license": "MIT" |
| **engines** | Specifies compatible Node.js versions. | "engines": { "node": ">=14.0.0" } |

**Tips for Managing package.json:**

- Regularly audit dependencies for vulnerabilities.
- Use semantic versioning (^, ~) for precise dependency management.
- Group related npm scripts and document their purposes for easier maintenance.
- Keep the file clean by removing unused dependencies with npm prune.

By following these practices, you can keep your package.json file well-organized and ensure your Node.js project remains efficient and manageable.

```
{
  "scripts": {
    "clean": "rm -rf dist/",
    "build": "webpack --mode production",
    "deploy": "npm run clean && npm run build && scp -r dist/ user@server:/path/to/project"
  }
}
```

**2\. Descriptive Names:**

Use clear and meaningful names for your scripts to make them self-explanatory.

Example:

```
{
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node app.js",
    "lint": "eslint .",
    "test": "jest"
  }
}
```

**3\. Avoid Hardcoding:**

Use environment variables for configurable paths and values instead of hardcoding them.

Example:

```
{
  "scripts": {
    "start-prod": "NODE_ENV=production node app.js"
  }
}
```

Run with:

```
npm run start-prod
```

**4\. Modularization:**

Keep scripts modular by combining smaller scripts into larger workflows using tools like npm-run-all.

Example:

```
{
  "scripts": {
    "clean": "rm -rf dist/",
    "build": "webpack --mode production",
    "start-all": "npm-run-all clean build"
  }
}
```

**5\. Error Handling:**

Ensure scripts handle errors gracefully and exit with appropriate exit codes. This helps in debugging and maintaining workflows.

Example:

```
{
  "scripts": {
    "validate": "eslint . || echo 'Linting failed!' && exit 1"
  }
}
```

**6\. Testing and Documentation:**

Test your scripts thoroughly in different scenarios and document their purpose for team members.

Example Documentation:

```
{
  "scripts": {
    "test": "jest",
    "build": "webpack --mode production"
  }
}
```

In your project README:

```
- \`npm run test\`: Runs all unit tests using Jest.
- \`npm run build\`: Compiles the project in production mode using Webpack.
```

By following these best practices, you can write robust, maintainable, and efficient package.json scripts, ensuring better collaboration and smoother development workflows.
